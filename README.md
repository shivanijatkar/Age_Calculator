# Age_Calculator

This code sets up a simple web page with an input field for entering a birthdate and a button to calculate the age. 
When the user clicks the button, JavaScript calculates the age based on the input date and displays it on the page. 
When user inputs his/her date of birth and clicks on calculate button the javascript calculates age and display the output in days, months, and years format. 
This project is a basic example and can be extended with more features like handling different date formats.
